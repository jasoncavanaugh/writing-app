# Writing App

A while back, I started writing my ideas in WhatsApp in a chat with myself. 
I found it easier to write in WhatsApp than in a typical word processor because for some reason it felt less "serious". 
I could just write my ideas down and each of them would be their own little speech bubble. 
I wouldn't feel as much pressure for each speech bubble to logically follow another, or that they would all cohere into something...coherent. 
It kinda felt like I was talking to a friend over a texting app.

The trouble is that WhatsApp isn't exactly designed for this sort of thing. 
While you can reply to a previous message, there wasn't a way to logically organize any of it. 
So one day, I would have a string of thoughts about _Dazed and Confused_ after having watched the movie for the first time, and the next I would be talking about whether human relationships were just value transactions. And if at any point I wanted to re-read my thoughts on a particular topic and perhaps refine them into something more, there was no easy way to find my messages other than just searching for them.

So I decided it would be great if I had something that provided me the same functionality as writing to myself
on WhatsApp, but where I could also group my ideas together. I thought the computer file system probably made the most sense, where a file would correspond to a speech bubble, and a directory would correspond to a grouping of speech bubbles. 

This app is a small proof of concept of that idea.
